# 433-rc-switch-orno

A repository to provide utils to control Remote Controlled switches made by ORNO.

Supported model ORNO model: OR-GB-405.
Specifications:
- Voltage: ~230V/50Hz
- Max. switching load: 1150W/5A
- Radio band: 433.05-434.79 MHz
- Power consumption: 0.3-0.5W (measured)

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Zero, 3, or 4
- Cheap 433MHz transmitter, see [this](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch/wiki/HowTo_Send) or [this](https://github.com/milaq/rpi-rf). I connected transmitter to 3V from RPi pin (pin 01), instead of 5V (just to be sure that transmitter won't burn)
- Antenna, can be coil or wire (~17cm for the best results). Transmitter might work without it for shorter distances.

## Software

- Python library: [rpi-rf](https://github.com/milaq/rpi-rf) - preferred way
Or alternatively:
- C++ code from [RPi_utils](https://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils/tree/master/RPi_utils) - the repository references [rc-switch](https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch/) that is being used on Arduino. However to run on RPi it requires [wiringpi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/) library that sadly for newer Raspberry OS like Bookworm is not officially available

## Code calculator 

Having everything connected, you go open calculator locally by going to `codes-calculator/index.html` on this cloned repo, or by using this [link](https://rawcdn.githack.com/pskowronek/433-rc-switch-orno/main/codes-calculator/index.html) (thanks to githack.com).

The calculator produces copy-paste example for both rpi-rf and 433Utils/RPi_utils.

The Calculator is a very basic HTML with JS - it has been generated by [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) v3.5 - this was a test whether chatGPT (LLM) can create a full working html page when provided details of algorithm (see below) etc... and apparently not exactly :) It took me another 2h to explain faults in the generated html/js and finally I've made manual changes to the code. But, the initial html was a good starting point. The whole coversation with chatGPT can be found [here](https://chat.openai.com/share/0981f9a2-b830-441f-970e-718a86f4a9fb). Probably I will re-try exactly the same prompts with chatGPT 4 and others.

Thanks the following projects the calculator could be written and exposed online:

- [rc-switches](https://github.com/lukaszgieraltowski/rc-switches): nice decoding graphs and protocol definition for `rc-switch` ([see here](https://github.com/lukaszgieraltowski/rc-switches/blob/6000257aac41d787f93845f05b68b976ef68314e/src/main.cpp#L40)). Contains also codes for CLARUS BHC993BF-3 RC switches
